# Photo-Storage-Website

Final project for a class called Web Development. 

We were tasked with creating a website that had user accounts, a database, some styling, and implemented a feature that was not taught in class. The content retrieved from the database had to be different based on the user that was logged in. Also any error messages needed to be displayed asynchronously. 

I created a website that allowed a user to login, upload photos, and view their photos. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The data was retrieved from a mySQL database using PHP. I handled error messaging using Ajax. As an extra feature, I created a task bar that showed the progress of a file upload. 

This repository shows a sample of my code.
